    <p>you wade down a stone ravine. the contact lens fluid comes to your belly.</p>
    <p>the ravine snakes like a bunched rope. above, stadium lights shine from a domed ceiling.</p>
    <p>the ravine is narrow, but your waist is more narrow.</p>
    <p>the banks are hedged by walls of saguaro. they have blooming clusters of yellow, thick spikes.</p>
    <p>the spikes gush clear fluid when disturbed. the fluid gives you a 106Â° fever.</p>
    <p>you try to squeeze by the saguaros without touching, but some spikes discharge into the ravine.</p>
    <p>you know the antidote is snakeskin. you see one downstream.</p>
    <p>as you get closer, the snakeskin turns into a huge millipede. it is covered in dirt.</p>
    <p>you wrap your fist around the millipede. then, you squeeze.</p>
