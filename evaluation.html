  <p>[a reclaimed psych evaluation]</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>natalie braginsky is a 15-year-old, right-handed, male student who recently completed the 10th grade at newton south high school in newton, massachusetts.</p>
  <p>according to natalie's parents, they are seeking this evaluation to determine if his academic and social struggles are related to executive functioning deficits, a mild cognitive impairment, and/or an underlying mood or anxiety disorder.</p>
  <p>natalie seems to have a poor conceptualization of time, according to his parents, and a half hour can go by without him realizing it.</p>
  <p>natalie also has difficulties with transitions, such as getting ready for school, and thus his parents often have to cue him before transitions occur.</p>
  <p>regarding natalie's socialization, his parents stated that recently he has been more solitary.</p>
  <p>natalie's parents talked about his difficulties with social skills, and said that when he was younger he would often read a book instead of playing with the other children.</p>
  <p>regarding depression, natalie's parents discussed that recently he has begun to overreact to small things or minor letdowns.</p>
  <p>they stated that natalie's overall mood appears to be depressed, and that his lack of interest in friends, his academic performance, and his future plans concerns them.</p>
  <p>they stated that at times he can "revert back to his old self and appear happy."</p>
  <p>according to his parents, natalie has difficulties with making friends, preferring to play alone, being uncomfortable with new people, and with overreacting to problems.</p>
  <p>natalie also complains about not being able to hear well, but his hearing has been evaluated by his physician, who did not find any significant problems with this sensory function.</p>
  <p>natalie's parents also discussed that natalie can hear them having quiet conversations in their room, which to them is evidence that his hearing is intact.</p>
  <p>natalie was alert and engaged during the evaluation. he initiated and maintained appropriate eye contact, and he responded appropriately to humor.</p>
  <p>his affect was variable; however, much of the time he presented with depressed mood and a flat affect.</p>
  <p>he often appeared to become discouraged when he felt that he was performing poorly on a given task.</p>
  <p>however, he engaged in appropriate social interaction, and was able to ask and answer questions when engaged in conversations with the examiner.</p>
  <p>his speech was fluent, prosodic, and grammatical. his dress and grooming were age appropriate.</p>
  <p>the only symptom he endorsed at the highest level [...] was his wish that he were dead. when asked about this,</p>
  <p>diagnostically, natalie meets criteria for depressive disorder, not otherwise specified.</p>
  <p>limiting factors:</p>
  <p>lack of self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness</p>
  <p>lack of effective and socially appropriate coping skills to deal with overwhelming feelings</p>
  <p>negative attitude toward school</p>
  <p>hopeless about the future</p>
  <p>loss of interest in activities that were previously enjoyed and withdrawal from social interactions</p>
  <p>lack of sleep</p>
