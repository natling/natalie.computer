    <p>it takes about 1 minute for every single blood cell in your body to pass back through the heart. given their 120 day lifespans, blood cells will in all likelihood visit every part of the body before they die.</p>
    <p>little is known about their individual travel habits. for example, what do they think when i stare at the sun too long? do they begin hoping to travel to the vessels in my eyes? what kind of vacation is it for blood, when eyes are bleached in sunlight?</p>
