    <p>in a skyscraper, somewhere in its grey maze of air ducts, there's a tiny tin hut. inside, a small team of nanobots huddles together, listening to the howling machine-conditioned air and the distant trickling of fluoridated water pipes. the nanobots' sensors gauge the air's various attributes: humidity, speed, direction (always the same), temperature. meanwhile, their spindly legs intermittently tap little glass pips, dutifully etching onto their surfaces terrible, procedurally generated poems about this wind.</p>
