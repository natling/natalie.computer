  <p>[a poem made out of my okcupid messages]</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>today i wandered around lower manhattan
  <br>there's not really a lot there
  <br>i certainly know that feeling</p>

  <p>i cried in a park a little but it was nice
  <br>sometimes i feel like i could write a whole pop punk album just from therapy
  <br>i'm sorry, that sounds painful
  <br>(one day they will learn to sing)</p>

  <p>you have very pretty eyes. are they green?
  <br>i'm really flattered!
  <br>wow usually i can think of something more interesting to say than that</p>

  <p>what's your favorite fruit?
  <br>any other ideas?
  <br>i really wish we were closer
  <br>oh wait
  <br>hope that's not offensive</p>

  <p>are you drunk
  <br>don't know much about trans so
  <br>want to go on a date?</p>

  <p>i'm not a fetish
  <br>oh wait
  <br>i feel the same way actually
  <br>but what made you think that?
  <br>but sometime i just stare straight ahead without seeing anything</p>

  <p>wow the nostalgia
  <br>i don't suppose you remember me
  <br>oh my god it's 1 am i need to sleep</p>

  <p>i'm visiting the city
  <br>it gets really lonely
  <br>i'm about to go take a shower. back in a bit</p>

  <p>i've been more confident lately and happier with how i look
  <br>and i would say that i'm pretty solid at dissociating on public transport
  <br>want to go on a date?
  <br>i've only ever dissociated once is this a dealbreaker</p>

  <p>but dissociating while driving is like "i am going to die", while dissociating on public transit is just kinda melancholic
  <br>too bad we're 6742 miles apart</p>

  <p>that sounds like something i should do
  <br>oh, and sex i guess</p>

  <p>have you ever read nevada by imogen binnie?
  <br>you're that gross dude no one wants to see
  <br>wait so you're trans?
  <br>were you thinking about something else?
  <br>it's so peaceful</p>

  <p>oh no
  <br>i guess the big idea or whatever is anomaly is not pathology</p>

  <p>yeah, i get that completely
  <br>okay here goes
  <br>sorry i'm feeling blunt
  <br>would you be interested in meeting up sometime?
  <br>oh it's okay don't worry it</p>

  <p>i live in my parents' basement.
  <br>never done that before
  <br>i slept through school today</p>

  <p>yeah, i get that completely
  <br>i do that a lot</p>

  <p>how was it?
  <br>i'm sorry
  <br>sorry, been super busy. we will talk again soon, i promise.</p>

  <p>i can talk to you in so many different ways
  <br>i wish we were closer</p>

  <p>what about you?
  <br>are you interested in dating guys or...?
  <br>take care of yourself
  <br>i feel the same way actually</p>

  <p>only once, when i was very young
  <br>that's probably healthy
  <br>yeah, that's understandable</p>

  <p>wait so you're trans?
  <br>one sec
  <br>that must be rough.</p>

  <p>i never expected it
  <br>and it totally took over my life</p>

  <p>that's fantastic
  <br>i feel the same way actually
  <br>i never expected it
  <br>aw. i did.
  <br>but i was never really serious about it</p>

  <p>then i decided to be a girl
  <br>wow that's amazing</p>

  <p>if you figure out how can femininity be empowered without just resembling masculinity, can you please tell me?
  <br>probably</p>

  <p>i never identified with masculinity at all
  <br>i know i get stared at a lot
  <br>but not in that way
  <br>plus when i drive i get those urges to drive into oncoming traffic
  <br>let me buy you a drink</p>

  <p>even sadness is better, you know? like today i wandered aimlessly around lower manhattan and cried in a park a little
  <br>nah, that doesn't sound like a lot of fun</p>

  <p>i'd rather feel anything than not feel at all
  <br>i think so, anyway</p>

  <p>i don't really care
  <br>probably
  <br>don't really feel like doing anything
  <br>hey, sorry i disappeared</p>

  <p>feeling glad i'm a girl
  <br>what a wonderful thing
  <br>wait so you're trans?
  <br>that's so terrible</p>

  <p>what kind of stuff do you do with it?
  <br>so no to sex?</p>

  <p>your profile says you're single
  <br>yeah, that makes sense
  <br>how was your day?
  <br>oh no
  <br>i totally understand that</p>

  <p>you know what i mean?
  <br>want to go on a date?
  <br>to answer your question, no
  <br>okay. well thank you for helping me understand.
  <br>it sounds like we'd get along really well</p>

  <p>i have to ask, what's so wrong with being a white male?
  <br>i'd love to show you
  <br>oh okay</p>

  <p>oh! want to hear a joke?
  <br>your profile is literally just your dick</p>

  <p>seriously?
  <br>you are so silly dude
  <br>i just find it so funny you can't just be a gay man with feminine attributes
  <br>how's that working out for you?</p>

  <p>thank god puberty is temporary...
  <br>it's been a lot better than i expected
  <br>at least so far
  <br>it's more exciting
  <br>oh that's good to hear
  <br>well i know my opinion doesn't mean much but you're really pretty so not much work is needed.
  <br>well i compare myself to other people
  <br>i've actually been feeling pretty good lately though! except for the loneliness
  <br>i keep thinking how much i like being a girl and how lucky i am to get to be myself
  <br>i hope it works out!</p>
