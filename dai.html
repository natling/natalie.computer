    <p>In the spring of 2017 I started writing computer programs that generate asemic writing. I had already been using procedural methods to create both visual art and text for several years and maybe it was inevitable that I would eventually combine the two, but the idea for my asemic project originated not as a synthesis of existing projects but rather as an outgrowth of my sudden fascination with the concept of writing without meaning.</p>
    <p>A simple and common way to conceptualize asemic writing is to view it as visual art that imitates language; that is, to define it in opposition to meaningful, linguistic, "real" writing. This conception draws a clear line and raises a critical question. Who determines that writing does or does not have meaning? In most cases we can expect general agreement that a set of symbols on a page or a stone or a screen is either linguistic or non-linguistic, but I believe that an examination of edge cases, in which the determination is not so clear, necessarily leads us to question the possibility of ever arriving at a universal binary classification of meaning and non-meaning.</p>
    <p>Calligraphy, typography, layout, and design have been present in writing since its independent invention across the world, and these elements all affect the interaction of a reader with a text. Even if we confine our attention to symbols, we cannot ignore the fact that people have been using paralinguistic symbols to communicate for longer than writing systems as we think of them today have existed. Emoji (a word which, by the way, comes from the Japanese words <i>e</i> [picture] and <i>moji</i> [character], and not from the purely coincidentally similar English word <i>emotion</i>) carry indispensable information in many modern forms of textual communication, and they are not, of course, a recent innovation. Cultures all over the world have used pictograms to represent ideas since before recorded history begins, and the writing systems of many languages originated as extensions of pictographic systems, including the logographic writing systems of ancient China, Egypt, and Sumer.</p>
    <p>Independently of both their complex intertwined relationship with natural language and their location on the spectrum from pictorial to abstract, the symbols we perceive affect us in ways that are often ambiguous. Many artists have explored this ambiguity. Xu Bing, the contemporary artist who in his famous asemic work <i>Book from the Sky</i> overwhelms the reader with over 4,000 invented and unintelligible characters, came out in 2012 with <i>Book from the Ground</i>, a 112-page novel composed entirely of pictograms gathered from disparate sources over the course of seven years. Aram Saroyan, a poet and writer but not a visual artist, wrote the unconventionally spelled one-word poem "lighght" and a one-letter poem consisting of a four-legged "m". These poems are visual and unpronounceable works, but they cannot be usefully analyzed without examining their relationship to language. People can respond viscerally to these minimalist works; right-wing politicians were incensed when the newly-created National Endowment for the Arts presented Saroyan with a $500 cash award.</p>
    <p>Several months after creating my first <a href="http://natalie.computer/scripts">asemic script generators</a>, I began working on <a href="http://natalie.computer/scribbles">animated versions of them</a>. Seeing my invented writing systems in the process of being written was a powerful experience. As I watched my computer scribbling away according to the rules I had set up, I was reminded that every use of language is also an action. As J. L. Austin and the other ordinary language philosophers argued with their theory of speech acts, an utterance can <i>do</i> something, affecting the social context in which it is articulated, and only a fraction of linguistic utterances assert a truth claim about the world.</p>
    <p>In December of 2017, with this is mind, I began working on a website that would appear to be an incomprehensible alien archive, a vast collection of information we can see but never truly access, compiled by unknown minds for equally unknown purposes. As I started prototyping the website, I decided not to use p5.js, a JavaScript library designed to serve as a visual sketchbook for programmers and the primary technical tool behind my earlier asemic experiments. Instead of thinking in terms of pixels on a web browser's canvas, as the conceptual model of p5.js encourages, I chose to represent the archive's script as actual browser text, subject to the same rules and formatting possibilities as any other information given to a browser in the form of the original medium of the internet: text.</p>
    <p>The first work to grow out of this effort was a continuous <a href="http://natalie.computer/archives">computational re-composition</a> of a corpus of epic poetry. In preparation for using asemic symbols generated by a program, I animated portions of an enormous collection of verse written and spoken by people. These lines overflow with meaning; they are the source of countless literary references that echo across millennia. But when presented with large blocks of small gray text plucked randomly from somewhere in the massive corpus, we are drowned in a sea of meaning. Almost as soon as a block of text appears, it is disassembled and swept away and replaced with another in an endless unreadable stream. Confronted with so much information, ephemerally showing itself and then disappearing far too quickly to be read, we extract no meaning at all.</p>
    <p>The main technical challenge to replacing the Roman letters of the poetry corpus with an asemic script is that a browser renders all text according to the specifications of a font file. To create asemic writing that a browser understands as text, it is necessary to design a font containing the blueprints for the invented writing system. My first attempt at this unfamiliar task is this <a href="http://natalie.computer/tangle">tangle of curves</a>, a non-linear overgrowth of typography that consists of true, selectable text.</p>

    <p>My second project is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nataliebraginsky/what-it-feels-like"><i>what it feels like</i></a>, a work of generative sound art. Over the course of 32 minutes, the only sounds used in the piece &mdash; mouse clicks, key presses, and the ambience of computers and disk drives humming away determinedly in an otherwise silent room &mdash; slowly grow from occasional, isolated interruptions into an overpowering accumulation so dense that no individual sounds can be heard over the immense gale created by their massed presence.</p>
    <p>The process of creating the piece was twofold. I made short recordings of the keyboard and mouse in my bedroom, where they live and where their sound is so familiar. I turned the gain knob on my microphone up, capturing every grainy little detail of the simple machinery in the hardware. Then, after carefully cutting out eight samples of the keyboard and seven of the mouse, along with a three-second loop of the sound of the room, I wrote a computer program to trigger the recordings more quickly and precisely than any human could.</p>
    <p>The program is relatively short, consisting of <a href="http://natalie.computer/what-it-feels-like">113 lines of code</a> in SuperCollider, a domain-specific computer language designed for algorithmic composition and real-time audio synthesis. The program layers the recording of the room over itself, continuously looping ten instances spread evenly across the stereo field. Each loop plays from a different starting point chosen from within its three-second duration. The loops blend into a thick, pulsating sheen of sound that is present from the beginning of the piece until the end. The silence behind the mouse clicks and key presses is not silence at all; the room is always buzzing with the hidden activity of computers left to their own devices.</p>
    <p>Five seconds into the quietly droning hiss, the sound of a key being pressed punctures the relative stillness. The program then waits for a period of time determined randomly, from a maximum of five seconds to a minimum of one, and plays another sound. For the next thirty minutes, this process is repeated, but the minimum and maximum wait time both slowly change, diminishing exponentially until the program is triggering one hundred recordings a second. By this point the clicking and pressing have turned into an unrelenting wall of sound. The torrent continues for another two minutes and then stops abruptly. The hissing of the room becomes audible again for another five seconds before it cuts out.</p>
    <p>What are we really listening to when we hear <i>what it feels like</i>? I have tried to grapple in some of my previous work with the uncontrollably vast rush of information brought to us by the technology we have weaved into our lives, as well as the sensory overload facing a damaged brain trying to keep up with reality. But for me these sounds carry a more personal resonance.</p>
    <p>The internet saved me. The internet made me a trans woman and I am unable to imagine myself without it. I don't know who I would have been. Most likely that person simply does not survive, but if in this imagined reality she does make it, I'm not sure I recognize her.</p>
